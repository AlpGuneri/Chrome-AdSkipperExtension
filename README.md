# Chrome-AdSkipperExtension
 # Chrome AdSkipper

 ## Overview:
 
 This Chrome extension automatically skips youtube ads. It's also pretty efficient at doing that by observing the page for changes, and it doesn't slow your browser down. 
 
 However, what's truly unique about this extension is the freedom it gives to its users, (and hopefully you!). It has an automatic skipping mode, which skips the ads
 automatically, similar to other adskippers, but it is possible to choose if you don't want to skip automatically, but have the skip ads button appear the second 
 the ad begins playing. This way you can directly skip the ads that don't seem interesting, and watch the ones that catch your eye.

Or you can simply choose not to skip. There's an option for that as well...
(yeah it may be unreasonable, but you can't have too much freedom)

 Please don't sue me youtube :))
