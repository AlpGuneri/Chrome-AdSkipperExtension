# Chrome-AdSkipperExtension
 This Chrome extension automatically skips youtube ads.

 What's more is that it is possible to choose if you don't want to skip
 automatically, but have the skip ads button appear, the second the ad begins playing. This way you can skip instantly, or choose to watch the ad
 if it catches your attention.

Or you can simply choose not to skip. There's an option for that as well...
(yeah it may be unreasonable, but you can't have too much freedom)

 Please don't sue me youtube :))
